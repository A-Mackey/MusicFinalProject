Choose a single, specific global culture and/or country.
It can be one that we discussed in class, but you are welcome to choose one that was not covered in class. For example:  China, Japan, Mexico, Ireland, India, or Argentina, etc... Anything you're interested in covering. 

Briefly describe specific and relevant cultural, geographical, and anthropological facts and information about this culture/country. 
Mainly, you're giving a brief description about the country whose music you'll be discussing in depth. 

Provide detailed description of the culture/country's musical history and context. 
This would include its traditional musics, native instruments, performance traditions, and anything else you can find. Musical/Video examples are required to support your research findings. 

Are there any pop artists who use or have used this culture's traditions in their music?
Per the ongoing theme of the class, discuss any cultural appropriation, whether or not the artist has taken advantage of the culture/tradition, or if it was appropriately used. Again, musical examples should be included to support your findings. 

Personal Statement: What about this culture have you grown to love or appreciate as a result of this project?
